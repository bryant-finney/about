My position as Hometap's first devops engineer provided a unique opportunity to help guide the team
through the challenges of its devops evolution. I was responsible for the design, implementation,
and support of the company's cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, automation tooling, and
application monitoring systems.
