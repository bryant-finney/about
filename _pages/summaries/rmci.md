After interning with RMCI during my senior year of college, I grew into a full-time role as embedded
systems engineer. I contributed to the development of [XRDS™️](https://www.rmci-inc.com/our-system/),
a single-board computer system that measured vibration signals from helicopter drive train
components to detect hardware faults.
