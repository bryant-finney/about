As an engineer at IERUS Technologies, I contributed to a variety of SBIR contracts for the
Department of Defense and similar research initiatives. I also worked on-site at Raytheon for
several subcontracts. My contributions included software development, radar processing/analysis,
and modeling/simulations.
