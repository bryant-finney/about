As a senior developer on a rapidly growing team, I was able to provide guidance and
technical insight to younger developers. Through effective collaboration,
troubleshooting, process development, and technical accomplishment, I established a
reputation as a subject matter expert for Docker, Python, Terraform, AWS, `git`, GitLab,
CI/CD, DevOps, and cloud-native web applications.
