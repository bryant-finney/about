As a senior developer on a rapidly growing team, I was able to provide the guidance
and technical insight to the team of younger developers. Through collaboration,
troubleshooting, process development, and professional advice, I established a
reputation as a subject matter expert for Docker, Python, Terraform, AWS, `git`, GitLab,
CI/CD, and DevOps.
