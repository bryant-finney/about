I was the primary contributor to the development and maintenance of a distributed web
application providing Django-based REST APIs and a React-based JavaScript frontend
hosted in an AWS [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) with redundancy managed through
Celery and [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for increased availability. The
application was designed to manage scheduling, status, communications, and operations of
an IoT fleet of utility power management devices utilizing cellular communication
technologies for the control of more than 70,000 billboard structures in the US,
Australia, and South America.

Being at a small company, this position was multifaceted and provided a number of
opportunities to contribute across the full software stack and development lifecycle.
