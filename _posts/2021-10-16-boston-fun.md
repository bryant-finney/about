Today, I joined the _Time Travel through History_ experience through
[airbnb <i class="fab fa-airbnb"></i>](https://www.airbnb.com/)

It was super cool; I highly recommend it.

I still can't get past what I learned about the trials of the British
soldiers involved in the
[Boston Massacre](https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/boston-massacre):

- John Adams (yes, the famous patriot John Adams) was the
  [soldiers' defense attorney](https://www.history.com/news/boston-massacre-trial-john-adams-dan-abrams)
- Josiah Quincy Jr. (another _patriot_) was also on the defense team of the British
  soldiers
- Samuel Quincy—Josiah Quincy Jr.'s brother, who was a _loyalist_—was one of the
  prosecution attorneys

After this, modern politics feels so much less mixed up now.
