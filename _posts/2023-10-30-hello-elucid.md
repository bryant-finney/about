I'm happy to join [Elucid](https://elucid.com/) as _Principal DevOps Engineer_. In this role, I will
be contributing to...

- üèóÔ∏è architecture, design, and implementation of build / deployment automation for our arterial analysis software
- üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è planning and implementation of platform infrastructure automation, collaborating closely with our engineering teams
- üî¨ infrastructure and application health monitoring services

As I get to know everyone, here's a little bit about myself.

## About Me

I was born at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO. Growing up an Air Force brat, I moved
around every few years. Most recently, my wife Emily and I moved to Boston in 2020.

I first started programming when I learned Pascal in middle school, later learning Java in high
school. I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alabama in
Huntsville, and after graduating I quickly worked my way into software development.

### Hobbies and Interests

I am fascinated by the evolution of open source software and the communities that it creates. I
enjoy contributing to open source Python libraries when I have time.

Dressing up as a tourist and exploring Boston is still one of my favorite pastimes. I especially
enjoy our museums and historical sites.
