I got to see the
[LOVE IS CALLING](https://www.icaboston.org/art/yayoi-kusama/love-calling) exhibit! It
was super trippy and wicked cool.

- From the outside, the piece just looks like a white box the size of a small room
- From the inside, mirrors and lighting turned it into a glowing forest

A couple of other pieces at the ICA explored the impacts of perception, space, and
contextual framing.

I also stopped by the
[street art installation at The Greenway](https://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/art/),
which always has a pleasant aesthetic.
