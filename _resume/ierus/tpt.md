- Developed test framework for verifying C++ implementations of different Kalman
  filter models
  - Used MatLab to build tracker program from C++ with autotools
  - Test cases in the framework ran the filter implementations on specified test
    data sets and then generated summary figures for quickly reviewing builds
  - Platform independence allowed the framework to be used as a manual build
    server
