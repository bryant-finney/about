- Analyzed the effectiveness of different machine-learning techniques and
  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designs when used to process radar measurement
  data
  - Used the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python package for
    training the ANNs from CentOS machines.
  - Created visualizations of ANN performance when classifying and
    labeling data according to the target feature space
  - Prototyped parallelization of ANN training source using bash
    scripts to mimic parallelized computing in Python
