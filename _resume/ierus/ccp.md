- Developed Python application for interactively controlling a vector network
  analyzer used to measure the condition of aircraft skin joints
  - Utilized Python's QT package for displaying data in realtime as RF
    measurements were taken
  - Created a Python connector to interface with the VNA's COM server
  - Created an emulator for the VNA's COM server to allow cross-platform
    development and testing until the COM-based drivers were replaced
