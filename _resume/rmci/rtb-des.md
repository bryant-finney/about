- Led a multidisciplinary team to design a new product for tracking helicopter
  rotor blades

  - Performed individual research and bench-marking, theoretical modeling using
    linear algebra and geometry, and data visualization for demonstrating theoretical
    system performance characteristics. Provided the recommendation for the selected
    design and continued to lead the development of this design
  - Conducted electro-optical radiometric modeling of solid state sensors for blade
    detection
  - Completed optical design of system hardware using matrix ray tracing in MathCAD,
    Python, and Matlab
  - Developed opto-mechanical design of illuminator and sensor to minimize space
    requirements while considering reliability, affordability, and maintainability
  - Reviewed materials and manufacturing processes for component design and selection
    - Design criteria included the following: overall size, weight, and cost; IR
      safety compliance according to `IEC 60825-1` and `IEC 62471`; insensitivity to
      environmental lighting conditions; environmental qualification according to
      `DO-160` and `MIL-STD-810`; hardware reliability, aesthetic appeal, and
      convenience of operation to the end user
  - The system is currently entering the prototype stage and is estimated to cost less
    than existing systems while improving performance and reducing maintenance costs

- Performed all engineering analysis, design, and fabrication of a stand for testing
  developmental systems
  - The stand replicated a scaled rotor of approximately `8 ft.` diameter, capable of
    rotational speed over `300 rpm`
  - Used finite airfoil drag analysis to model the transient and steady-state speed based
    on input power. Total cost was under `$1,000`, and the test stand was used for rotor track
    and balance tests
