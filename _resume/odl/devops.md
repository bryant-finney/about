- Pushed testing left by developing multistage CI/CD pipelines for automating the
  following tasks:
  - code static analysis, linting, formatting, style checks, test suite execution, and
    coverage reporting
  - dependency updates, package installation, runtime image builds, documentation
    builds, and deployments to test and production environments
- Maintained internal [GitLab <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i>](https://about.gitlab.com/) server for hosting
  project repositories, collaborating on feature requests and bug fixes, and reviewing
  code changes and deployments
- Containerized applications with
  [Docker <i class="fab fa-docker"></i>](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) to support
  concurrent test suite executions across on-prem servers, reducing the feedback cycle
  for testing requested changes to the codebase
